			<p> I am a Pittsburgh based designer and technologist who specializes both 
				in lighting design and physical computing. The combination of these 
				two fields leads to an interesting combination of art and technology
				I intend to make a career out of.<br><br>
				
				I have been a lighting designer for about 6 years, primarily focusing
				on education and community theatre ,designing for plays, musicals,
				dance, and opera.<br><br>
				
				As a technologist, I worked in the robotics industry for a few years
				before transitioning into the electronic media industry. I have 
				spent a lot of time as a Quality Assurance technician, but have
				collaborated on many projects involving hardware, software, and 
				integration.
